= Vancouver Polyglot Haskell Workshop

This project is intended to serve as a guide to teaching basics of
Haskell + some _real world_ bits.

To get started check the different tags on the project, and try to
complete the undefined functions on each of them. For every tag that
has a challenge there is a _solution tag with practical result.

This project is incomplete, and it won't make much sense unless you
are with me (Roman Gonzalez) at the workshop. Some work will be done
in the future to make this more understendable and usable outside the
Polyglot Workshop.
